### Course Description

An experiential exploration of persuasive communication through the use of both
conceptual frameworks and software tools. This hands-on course introduces
templates and techniques for crafting compelling written and oral arguments.
Leveraging accessible computer programs such as integrated development
environments, digital audio workstations, and artificial intelligence
assistants, students work in teams to produce and publish engaging content
through websites, videos, and podcasts. This seminar develops written and oral
communication skills with an emphasis on persuasive communication in an
academic context.

- **Prerequisite**: FS 101

### Learning Objectives

Allegheny Collegeâ€™s educational program is designed so that its graduates are able to:

- **AC-1**: Think critically and creatively.

- **AC-2**: Communicate clearly and persuasively as speakers and writers.

- **AC-3**: Invoke multiple ways of understanding to organize and evaluate
evidence, and to interpret and make sense of their experiences and the
experiences of others.

- **AC-4**: Apply their knowledge and learning to engage in informed debate,
and to analyze and solve problems.

#### Global Expectations for Students in the FS Program

- To become able readers, listeners, speakers, and writers acting in a variety
of genres, occasions, and purposes.
- To develop an awareness of audience and its effects on the creation and
delivery of ideas.
- To use the ideas of others to advance thinking.
- To understand reading and listening as acts of inquiry. Learning Outcomes
Specific to FS 101
- To recognize and express interesting ideas of intellectual value.
- To develop an engaging voice as a speaker and writer.
- To organize ideas effectively to communicate in specific contexts.
- To use language clearly, powerfully, and with appropriate detail.

As a review, these elements should appear inside of an FS 101 course that is the
prerequisite for this course:

- Regular opportunities to speak in class and short writing assignments
- No fewer than 10 pages of assigned writing, excluding revisions
- At least two formal writing assignments of 3-5 pages that include the
possibility of revision at least one formal speech assignment (4-5 minutes) that
includes preparatory work
- Library research as a part of at least one of the writing or speech
assignments at least two one-on-one meetings with each student.

#### Learning Outcomes Specific to FS 102

- To participate in a sustained conversation with other academic writers and speakers.
- To generate a thesis that addresses a clearly defined problem.
- To support a thesis with appropriate reading and evidence.
- To communicate in progressively complex and nuanced ways.

These elements should appear inside of an FS 101 course that is the
prerequisite for this course:

In particular, the faculty encourages FS instructors to incorporate the
following elements into the design of Academic Discourse II:

- Regular opportunities to speak in class.
- No fewer than 20 pages of assigned writing, excluding revisions.
- At least three writing assignments (4-6 pages) that include the possibility of
revision.
- At least two speech assignments (total of 12-16 minutes) that include outline
development and extemporaneous delivery research, with close attention to source
credibility, as a substantial part of at least one of the writing or speech
assignments.

Note: The context in this section was, with minor exception, directly quoted
from the following web site: [First-Year/Sophomore (FS)
Program](https://sites.allegheny.edu/facultyresources/fsprogram/).

### Course Textbooks

There are no course textbooks for the Exposition Engineering course. Instead,
the course instructor will assign readings from a variety of sources that
connect to the theme of the course. For instance, you will review web-based
sources that explain how to complete writing assignments with software tools and
others that introduce the key steps to, for instance, creating a podcast.

### Course Policies

#### Assessment

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, the course instructor may, for instance, change the assigned
percentages during the academic semester.

| Category                 | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Class Participation      |  10%       |
| Midterm Examination      |  15%       |
| Final Examination        |  15%       |
| Algorithm All-Hands      |  10%       |
| Algorithm Engineering    |  50%       |

These assessment categories have the following definitions:

- **Class Participation**: Students are expected to regularly attend and
actively participate in all of the class and laboratory sessions, as outlined on
the [course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd). After either an unexcused absence
or a late attendance to either a class or a laboratory session, a student's
weekly class participation grade will be reduced. Students who need to miss
class or attend class late for an excused reason should communicate their
situation to the instructor in a timely fashion. After one warning per week, a
student's weekly class participation grade will be reduced if they are observed
undertaking non-course-related activities like viewing email, social media, or
other content not about algorithm analysis. 

- **Midterm Examination**: The midterm examination is an online, executable, and
cumulative assessment covering all prior material from the course sessions, as
outlined on the [course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd). Unless prior
arrangements are made with the instructor, all students should use their
computer to take these tests on the scheduled date and to complete it in the
stated location while taking no more than the required amount of time. The
midterm is an executable examination that students will complete through the use
of GitHub, VS Code, and the Python programming tools installed on their laptops.
Following the completion of the midterm examination during a laboratory session,
students will, during algorithm all-hands sessions, collaboratively complete and
present an analytical and empirical evaluation of the performance of one
component of their examination.

- **Final Examination**: The final examination is an online, executable,
cumulative assessment covering all of the material during all of the course
sessions, as outlined on the [course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd). Unless
prior arrangements are made with the course instructor, all students should use
their computer to take the final examination on the scheduled date and to
complete it in the stated location while taking no more than the required amount
of time. The cumulative final is an executable examination that a student will
complete through the use of GitHub, VS Code, and the Python programming tools
installed on their laptops.

- **Algorithm All-Hands**: These projects enable students to explore both the
scientific and engineering aspects of algorithm analysis, as outlined in the
[course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd). During the completion of a *scientific
study* in the field of algorithm analysis, students will complete and present a
team-based project in which they propose and then answer a research question
about the performance of a Python program. When completing an *engineering
effort* in the field of algorithm analysis, students will build and present a
team-based project in which they design, implement, document, release, and
maintain a software tool that supports the rigorous evaluation of the
performance of a Python program.

#### Assessment Policies

Unless exempted by the instructor, students must abide by the following
assessment policies:

##### Assignment Submission

All assignments will have a stated due date shared through GitHub, GitHub
Classroom, and/or the [Algorithmology Discord](https://discord.gg/YHjhQaBnme).
No credit will be awarded for any course work that you submit to the incorrect
GitHub repository or web site. Unless special arrangements are made with the
instructor to address extenuating circumstances, no work will be accepted after
the deadline.

##### Assignment Evaluation

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through your GitHub
repositories devoted to work in the field of algorithm analysis, you will
privately receive a grade for and feedback on your course projects. Your grade
will be a function of whether or not you completed work that fulfills the
project's specification and submitted it by the deadline to the stated platform.

##### Algorithmology Tokens

Students may "spend" up to five algorithmology "tokens" that they may use to
either (i) secure 48 hours of additional time to complete an assigned task or
(ii) request a reassessment of an already graded project after revising it
according to feedback from the instructor. For instance, a student may choose to
spend a token by asking the instructor to reevaluate one of the algorithm
engineering projects. Outside of these five tokens, the instructor will not
consider any additional requests for deadline extensions or assignment
reassessment.

##### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions. If, due to
extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session, then,
whenever possible, please communicate with the instructor at least one week in
advance to describe your situation. Students who have any signs of illness
should not attend any in-person course sessions.

##### Class Preparation

In order to minimize confusion and maximize learning, students must invest time
to prepare for the class sessions that focus on professional development,
technical development, and project development. Although the course instructor
and the student technical leaders will always be available to serve as guide for
individual students, teams of students, and the entire class, it is expected
that students will volunteer to lead and actively contribute to all class
sessions. Only those students who have prepared for class by reading and running
the assigned material will be able to effectively participate in these class
discussions. To help students remain organized and to effectively prepare for
classes, the instructor will maintain a list of [course
slides](../slides/index.qmd) and a [course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd) with
reading assignments and other important information about the course (e.g.,
references to the algorithm engineering projects).

#### Seeking Assistance

Students who are struggling to understand the knowledge and skills developed in
any of the course sessions are encouraged to seek assistance from the course
instructor and/or the student technical leaders. Students should, within the
bounds of the Honor Code, ask and answer questions on the [Algorithmology
Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YHjhQaBnme); please request assistance from
the instructor and student technical leaders first through public Discord
channels before sending an email. Students who need the course instructor's
assistance are invited to schedule a meeting through the [course instructor's
appointment scheduler](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) and come to
the meeting with all of the details needed to discuss their question. Students
can find out the office hour schedule for student technical leaders by viewing
the list of [student technical
leaders](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Using GitHub and Discord

This course will primarily use GitHub and Discord for all course communication.
We will use GitHub for the sharing of both source code and course projects and
for reporting issues in those materials. We will use two distinct Discord
servers for all course discussions. The [Algorithmology Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/YHjhQaBnme) provides a way for members of the
developer development community to use text and video to chat with each other
and will be the main forum for discussing the professional and technical content
in software engineering. The [Allegheny College Computer Science Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6) will be the main forum for Department of
Computer Science announcements. Finally, any content that a student wants the
instructor to assess (e.g., the work for an algorithm engineering project) must
be in a GitHub repository.

#### Using Email

Although we will primarily use the [Algorithmology Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/YHjhQaBnme) for class communication, the course
instructor will sometimes use email to send announcements about important
matters such as changes in the schedule. It is your responsibility to check your
email at least once a day and to ensure that you can reliably send and receive
emails. This class policy is based on the statement about the use of email that
appears in *The Compass*, the College's student handbook; please see the course
instructor if you do not have this handbook.

#### Honor Code

The Allegheny College Academic bulletin describes The Academic Honor Program
that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College. The Honor Program
applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit
requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work
assigned for this class (e.g., executable examinations and course assignments).
All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.
Each student who matriculates at the College acknowledges this Honor Code
pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
> defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
> myself and the College community as a whole.

#### Effective Algorithm Engineering

Students who create the source code and documentation for their algorithm
engineering and algorithm all-hands projects should ensure the implementation of
a high-quality final product. While students are permitted to use a wide variety
of software engineering tools, such as integrated development environments,
testing frameworks, automated debuggers, and code generators (e.g., systems that
leverage large language models like GitHub Copilot) and documentation sites such
as StackOverflow, they must take responsibility for all of the source code and
documentation that they submit for this course, including artifacts that are
automatically generated by a software tool.

This means that every student must work as an effective algorithm engineer by
documenting the sources for their work and verifying the correctness,
maintainability, and long-term reliability of all source code and documentation
that they submit. As such, students who uses software tools to create content
are responsible for citing their sources and demonstrating their understanding
of it during the in-person assessments. Moreover, all students in the class are
responsible for all of the source code and documentation submitted to the GitHub
repository that hosts the course projects, including any tool-generated software
artifacts. This means that every student should be able to answer questions,
during either an in-person or online discussion, about any technical or
professional content, including that which was automatically generated by a
software tool.

Students who are effective algorithm engineers also pledge to abide by the [ACM
Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).
Unless the students in this course furnish a different governing contract, they
also pledge to follow the principles espoused by exemplary technical
organizations, such as [Oxide Computer](https://oxide.computer/) and its public
statement of [mission and principles](https://oxide.computer/principles).

#### Disability Services

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this
class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services
(SASS) at 814-332-2898 or `studentaccessibility@allegheny.edu`. SASS is located
in the Center for Student Success in Pelletier Library. Please contact SASS as
soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a
timely fashion.

### Welcome Message

In reference to software, Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. wrote in chapter one of *The
Mythical Man Month* that "the magic of myth and legend has come true in our
time." Software is a pervasive aspect of our society that changes how we think
and act. High quality and efficient software also has the potential to
positively influence the lives of many people. At the start of this class, I
invite you to join together in an adventure in algorithm analysis!
