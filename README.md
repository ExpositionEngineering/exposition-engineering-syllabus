### Course Description

An experiential exploration of persuasive communication through the use of both
conceptual frameworks and software tools. This hands-on course introduces
templates and techniques for crafting compelling written and oral arguments.
Leveraging accessible computer programs such as integrated development
environments, digital audio workstations, and artificial intelligence
assistants, students work in teams to produce and publish engaging content
through websites, videos, and podcasts. This seminar develops written and oral
communication skills with an emphasis on persuasive communication in an
academic context.

- **Prerequisite**: FS 101

### Learning Objectives

Allegheny Collegeâ€™s educational program is designed so that its graduates are able to:

- Think critically and creatively.

- Communicate clearly and persuasively as speakers and writers.

- Invoke multiple ways of understanding to organize and evaluate evidence, and
to interpret and make sense of their experiences and the experiences of others.

- Apply their knowledge and learning to engage in informed debate, and to
analyze and solve problems.

#### Global Expectations for Students in the FS Program

- To become able readers, listeners, speakers, and writers acting in a variety
of genres, occasions, and purposes.
- To develop an awareness of audience and its effects on the creation and
delivery of ideas.
- To use the ideas of others to advance thinking.
- To understand reading and listening as acts of inquiry.

#### Learning Outcomes Specific to FS 101

- To recognize and express interesting ideas of intellectual value.
- To develop an engaging voice as a speaker and writer.
- To organize ideas effectively to communicate in specific contexts.
- To use language clearly, powerfully, and with appropriate detail.

As a review, these elements should appear have been evident in the FS 101
course that is the prerequisite for this course:

- Regular opportunities to speak in class and short writing assignments
- No fewer than 10 pages of assigned writing, excluding revisions
- At least two formal writing assignments of 3-5 pages that include the
possibility of revision at least one formal speech assignment (4-5 minutes) that
includes preparatory work
- Library research as a part of at least one of the writing or speech
assignments at least two one-on-one meetings with each student.

#### Learning Outcomes Specific to FS 102

- To participate in a sustained conversation with other academic writers and speakers.
- To generate a thesis that addresses a clearly defined problem.
- To support a thesis with appropriate reading and evidence.
- To communicate in progressively complex and nuanced ways.

These elements should appear inside of an FS 101 course that is the
prerequisite for this course:

In particular, the faculty encourages FS instructors to incorporate the
following elements into the design of Academic Discourse II:

- Regular opportunities to speak in class.
- No fewer than 20 pages of assigned writing, excluding revisions.
- At least three writing assignments (4-6 pages) that include the possibility of
revision.
- At least two speech assignments (total of 12-16 minutes) that include outline
development and extemporaneous delivery research, with close attention to source
credibility, as a substantial part of at least one of the writing or speech
assignments.

**Note**: The context in this section was, with minor exception, directly
quoted from the following web site: [First-Year/Sophomore (FS)
Program](https://sites.allegheny.edu/facultyresources/fsprogram/).

### Course Textbooks

There are no course textbooks for the Exposition Engineering course. Instead,
the course instructor will assign readings from a variety of sources that
connect to the theme of the course. For instance, you will review web-based
sources that explain how to complete writing assignments with software tools and
tutorials that introduce the key steps to creating a podcast. Alternative
sources for course textbooks will include the audio and transcripts for podcast
episodes.

### Course Policies

#### Assessment

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, the course instructor may change the assigned percentages
during the academic semester.

| Category                 | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Course Participation     |  20%       |
| Show Proposals           |  20%       |
| Show Outlines            |  20%       |
| Engineered Expositions   |  10%       |
| Peer Reviews             |  10%       |
| Recorded Episodes        |  10%       |
| Podcast Presentations    |  10%       |

Here are some additional details about the recording and reporting of the course
assessments:

- **Course Participation**: This includes all of the course participation
scores that reflect your timely attendance in class, participation in class
activities such as stand-up meetings, and participation in the course
discussions on Discord. This also includes the assessment of any supporting
assignments focused on creating, for instance, the visual and audio identity of
the course's podcast. This also includes a certification that a learner
demonstrated competency during the use of the software, like VS Code and
GitHub, that supports the operation of a podcasting studio. Finally, this
includes a certification that a student demonstrated a careful competency with
the use of the recording hardware and software. Since participation is an
integral part of the course, any student who misses more than ten class
sessions will automatically fail the class.
- **Show Proposals**: This includes the assessment of two show proposals that
offer information about the theme of and guest for an episode of a podcast.
Each show proposal must appear as a file in a GitHub repository that originated
from GitHub Classroom and contains a commit history demonstrating consistent
work towards the completion of the writing assignment.
- **Show Outlines**: This includes the assessment of two show outlines that
feature written content for an introduction to both the podcast and the guest,
a detailed series of questions for the question, and a conclusion to the
podcast episode. Each show outline must appear as a file in a GitHub repository
that originated from GitHub Classroom and contains a commit history
demonstrating consistent work towards the completion of the writing assignment.
- **Engineered Expositions**: This includes the assessment of writing
assignments in which the learner engages a thorough and nuanced conversation
with other writers in the field of exposition engineering. These assignments
invite learner to develop a thesis, using primary sources and their experiences
with software and hardware tools, about how technology influences written
communication. These assignments may require a learner to use artificial
intelligence (AI) writing assistants to experientially investigate how software
changes the process of and final artifacts arising from written communication.
Each engineered exposition must appear as a file in a GitHub repository that
originated from GitHub Classroom and contains a commit history demonstrating
consistent work towards the completion of the writing assignment.
- **Peer Reviews**: The course instructor will assign students to work with
multiple peer review partners throughout the semester. This category includes
the assessment of peer reviews that a student submits to the pull request (PR)
in the GitHub repository of their peer review partner. Each student is
responsible for adding to a separate GitHub repository a list of the PRs that
they submitted to the GitHub repository of their peer review partner so as to
facilitate the assessment of the completed peer reviews.
- **Recorded Episodes**: Along with the certification that a learner completed
the required training for use of the podcasting studio, this includes the
single-take recording, editing, and audio engineering of two podcast episodes,
the final versions of which must be uploaded in `WAV` and `MP3` format to a
Google Drive. If time permits, the course instructor will make these podcast
episodes available on a podcast web site and through podcast hosting platforms
such as Spotify.
- **Podcast Presentations**: This includes the assessment for a practice
presentation that was previously developed through brainstorming and outlining
assignments and the assessment of a final presentation given on the day of the
final examination, Friday, May 3, 2024 at 9:00 AM.
- **Final Grade**: This score is a percentage out of 100%. When this score is
part of an interim report it may represent an over-estimate of a student's
final grade because of the fact that it incorporates other over-estimates in
one of its constituent scores. This score weights the constituent scores
according to the percentages that are provided in the table in this document.

#### Assessment Policies

Unless exempted by the instructor for documented reasons and/or extenuating
circumstances, students must abide by the following assessment policies:

##### Assignment Submission

All assignments will have a stated due date shared through GitHub, GitHub
Classroom, and/or the [Exposition Engineering
Discord](https://discord.gg/HMjSBtrUV9). No credit will be awarded for any
course work that you submit to the incorrect GitHub repository or web site.
Unless special arrangements are made with the instructor to address extenuating
circumstances, no work will be accepted after the deadline.

##### Assignment Evaluation

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through your GitHub
repositories devoted to work in the field of algorithm analysis, you will
privately receive a grade for and feedback on your course projects. Your grade
will be a function of whether or not you completed work that fulfills the
project's specification and submitted it by the deadline to the stated platform.

##### Exposition Engineering Tokens

Students may "spend" up to five exposition engineering "tokens" that they may
use to either (i) secure 48 hours of additional time to complete an assigned
task or (ii) request a reassessment of an already graded project after revising
it according to feedback from the instructor. For instance, a student may choose
to spend a token by asking the instructor to reevaluate one of the algorithm
engineering projects. Outside of these five tokens, the instructor will not
consider any additional requests for deadline extensions or assignment
reassessment.

##### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions. If, due to
extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session, then,
whenever possible, please communicate with the instructor at least one week in
advance to describe your situation. Students who have any signs of illness
should not attend any in-person course sessions. Since participation is an
integral part of the course, any student who misses more than ten class
sessions will automatically fail the class.

##### Class Preparation

In order to minimize confusion and maximize learning, students must invest time
to prepare for the class sessions that focus on professional development,
technical development, and project development. Although the course instructor
and the student technical leaders will always be available to serve as guide
for individual students, teams of students, and the entire class, it is
expected that students will volunteer to lead and actively contribute to all
class sessions. Only those students who have prepared for class by reading and
running the assigned material will be able to effectively participate in these
class discussions. To help students remain organized and to effectively prepare
for classes, the instructor will, at the start of class and through the
course's Discord server, make regular announcements about the tasks that are
the focus of each week.

#### Seeking Assistance

Students who are struggling to understand the knowledge and skills developed in
any of the course sessions are encouraged to seek assistance from the course
instructor and/or the student technical leaders. Students should, within the
bounds of the Honor Code, ask and answer questions on the [Exposition
Engineering Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HMjSBtrUV9); please request
assistance from the instructor and student technical leaders first through
public Discord channels before sending an email. Students who need the course
instructor's assistance are invited to schedule a meeting through the [course
instructor's appointment scheduler](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/)
and come to the meeting with all of the details needed to discuss their
question. Students can find out the office hour schedule for student technical
leaders by viewing the list of [student technical
leaders](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Using GitHub and Discord

This course will primarily use GitHub and Discord for all course communication.
We will use GitHub for the sharing of both source code and course projects and
for reporting issues in those materials. We will use two distinct Discord
servers for all course discussions. The [Exposition Engineering Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/HMjSBtrUV9) provides a way for members of the
developer development community to use text and video to chat with each other
and will be the main forum for discussing the professional and technical content
in software engineering. The [Allegheny College Computer Science Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6) will be the main forum for Department of
Computer Science announcements. Finally, any content that a student wants the
instructor to assess (e.g., the work for an algorithm engineering project) must
be in a GitHub repository.

#### Using Email

Although we will primarily use the [Exposition Engineering Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/HMjSBtrUV9) for class communication, the course
instructor will sometimes use email to send announcements about important
matters such as changes in the schedule. It is your responsibility to check your
email at least once a day and to ensure that you can reliably send and receive
emails. This class policy is based on the statement about the use of email that
appears in *The Compass*, the College's student handbook; please see the course
instructor if you do not have this handbook.

#### Honor Code

The Allegheny College Academic bulletin describes The Academic Honor Program
that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College. The Honor Program
applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit
requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work
assigned for this class (e.g., executable examinations and course assignments).
All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.
Each student who matriculates at the College acknowledges this Honor Code
pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
> defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
> myself and the College community as a whole.

#### Effective Exposition Engineering

Students who create the any type of writing, speaking, or peer review should
ensure the creation of a high-quality final product. While students are
permitted to use a wide variety of exposition engineering tools, such as grammar
checkers, idea generators, text writers, and text revisers, including
intelligent systems that leverage large language models like GitHub Copilot or
ChatGPT, they must take responsibility for all of the content that they submit
for this course, including artifacts that are automatically generated and/or
reviewed by a software tool.

Students who uses software tools to create content are responsible for citing
their sources and demonstrating their understanding of it during the in-person
discussions. Moreover, all students in the class are responsible for all of the
written documentation submitted to the GitHub repository that hosts the course
projects, including any tool-generated written artifacts. This means that every
student should be able to answer questions, during either an in-person or
online discussion, about any technical or professional content, including that
which was automatically generated by a software tool.

Students who are effective algorithm engineers also pledge to abide by the [ACM
Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).
Unless the students in this course furnish a different governing contract, they
also pledge to follow the principles espoused by exemplary technical
organizations, such as [Oxide Computer](https://oxide.computer/) and its public
statement of [mission and principles](https://oxide.computer/principles).

#### Disability Services

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this
class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services
(SASS) at 814-332-2898 or `studentaccessibility@allegheny.edu`. SASS is located
in the Center for Student Success in Pelletier Library. Please contact SASS as
